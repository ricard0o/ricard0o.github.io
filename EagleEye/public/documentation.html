    <p>Our application does not have any installation because it is a web application. 
      <br>In order to run our application on a server you must first make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
      <br>Then open up your terminal and enter the commands "npm install" and then "npm start-watch". 
      <br>The application is now running on a server. Go to localhost:4000 in your internet browser and you will be able to use our application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not written any tests for our software. 
      <br>The api endpoint that we use for our GET request was https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/wb4e-w4nf.json?. 
    </p>
      We have a known bug whenever a user wants to do a second search with the application they need to refresh the page. 
      <br>Another known bug we have is that the max number of entries we were receiving from the database was 1000. 
      <br>The database has over 90,000 entries but for some reason it did not all come through with the JSON data. 
      <br>In the future we are going to end up tackling these bugs and then adding on a lot more functionality to the application. 
      <br>We would like the expand the data from Prince George's County to all of Maryland by gathering data from all the Police department databases. 
      <br>Other features we would love to have is more filtering options, such as dates. 
      <br>We also want to eventually overlay our data on a map so that the user can visualize the data better and utilize the application more effectively.
