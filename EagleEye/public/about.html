    <h2>About us</h2>
    <div class = "about">
      Eagle Eye is about connecting the Prince Georgeâ€™s county community to the crime data that is collected by the police department in order to allow citizens to make informed decisions and keep themselves safe. 
      Prince George's country has one of the highest crime rates in Maryland. Eagle Eyes aims to help curb this statistic by giving residents access to the police crime data. This way they can avoid high crime areas
      and be aware of the incidents happening around them and the rest of the county.
