      <h3>Problem:  </h3>
      <d> 
        According to the ​Maryland Statistical Analysis Center (MSAC), Prince George County (PGC) has the second highest crime rate in the state of Maryland.
        Ideally, every resident in PG county should have access to crime rate statistics in order to allow them to make informed decisions and keep themselves safe. 
        Unfortunately,there is a lack of tools providing this kind of service. My solution empowers users with the ability to make judgements on areas they should stay away from.</d>
      
      <h3>Goal:  </h3>
      <d>
       My goal is to improve public safety by providing citizens with information to raise awareness about crime prevention.

      </d>
      <h3>Solution:  </h3>
      <d>
        For this reason, I have created a front end web application where residents can input a zip code, address or city-name. 
        The website would then present them with a report highlighting safety recommendations for that location.
