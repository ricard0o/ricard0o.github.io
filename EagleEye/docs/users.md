Prince George County continues to have the second highest crime rate in the state of Maryland as evident by the Maryland Statistical Analysis Center (MSAC).
Every resident in PG county should have access to crime rate statistics as a way to empower them with the ability to make judgements in regards to areas they should stay away from.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of tools providing this kind of service.
For this reason, we have decided to create a front end web application where residents can input a zip code, address or city name.
The website would then present them with a report highlighting safety recommendations for that location. 

In order to fully utilize our application users must input values that match exactly to what exists in the current database. 
For "Crime Type" the following options are what is available in the dropdown menu that is on the home page:
"ACCIDENT", "THEFT FROM AUTO", "THEFT", "ASSAULT", "ASSAULT, WEAPON", "ASSAULT, SHOOTING", "AUTO, STOLEN & RECOVERED", 
"SEX OFFENSE", "AUTO, STOLEN", "ROBBERY, OTHER", "ROBBERY, COMMERCIAL", "HOMOCIDE", "VANDALISM", "B & E, VACANT", "B & E, OTHER", 
"B & E, RESIDENTIAL", "B & E, COMMERCIAL", "B & E, RESIDENTIAL (VACANT)"

For Street Number and address input any street number or street address and the application will give the user the number of crime incidents that have occurred there.
After use, in order to receive new data about a different search query the user must refresh the page in order to reset the application and use it again.
